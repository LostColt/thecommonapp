<p>The essay is not a greatest hits reel. It's not a performance. It's about finding out what you actually want to say.</p>
<h3><strong>The Challenge</strong></h3>
<p>The college essay is different from every other essay you’ve written. Academic essays have clear rubrics and established structures. In a sense, they test you on what you have learned. The college essay asks you to do something radically different, which is to write as a way to examine and explore your life.</p>

<p>The college essay is different from every other essay you've written. Academic essays test what you've learned. The college essay asks you to do something harder: look at your own life and figure out what you actually want to say about it.</p>
