<p>Most first drafts sound like this:</p>
<blockquote>"I joined the robotics team and then we started building the robot and then we competed and then we won the regional championship and then I learned the value of teamwork."</blockquote>
<p>This is <strong>chronology</strong>, not reflection. You're telling me what happened in order, but you're not pausing to think about what it meant. The story moves forward, but it never goes deeper.</p>

<h2>The Fix</h2>
<p>You don't owe the reader the full story. You owe them your <strong>thinking</strong>.</p>
<p>You need to <strong>interrupt the story</strong> to examine what's beneath the surface.</p>
<p>Think of it like this:</p>
<li><strong>Chronology</strong> = "This happened, then this happened, then this happened."</li>
<li><strong>Reflection</strong> = "Stop the tape. Why did that specific moment surprise me? What was I assuming <em>before</em> it happened? What does it reveal about how I see the world?"</li></div>
