<h2>The Challenge</h2>
<p>The college essay is different from every other essay you’ve written. Academic essays have clear rubrics and established structures. In a sense, they test you on what you have learned. The college essay asks you to do something you rarely practice, which is to write as a way to examine your life. </p>
<h1><strong>Writing as a tool for discovery. </strong></h1>

<h2>Topics vs. Moments</h2>
<p>Before you start writing, it is important to know the difference between a topic and a moment. The first mistake students make is that they start too broadly.</p>
<p>Academic essays have clear rubrics and established structures. They test what you've <strong>learned</strong>.</p>
<p>The college essay asks you to do something harder: look at your own life and figure out what you actually want to say about it.</p>
<p><strong>This isn't a greatest hits reel.</strong> It's not the saddest story you can think of. It's not what you think admissions officers want to hear. It's about <strong>discovery</strong>-writing to uncover your thoughts, not just reporting what you already know.</p>
<blockquote>"Between the grades, the activities, and the accomplishments on your transcript, who are you?"</blockquote>
<p>Before you can answer that, you need to find your material. The students who write the strongest essays spend time here-exploring their experiences, finding moments that matter, and drafting to discover what they actually have to say.</p>
<p><strong>Don't skip this step.</strong></p>
