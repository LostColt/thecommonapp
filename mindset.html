      <h1 class="page-title">The College Essay Is Different.</h1>
      <p class="page-subtitle">It's not about what you've learned. It's about who you are.</p>
      <div class="prose"><p>Academic essays have clear rubrics and established structures. They test what you've <strong>learned</strong>.</p>
<p>The college essay asks you to do something harder: look at your own life and figure out what you actually want to say about it.</p>
<p><strong>This isn't a greatest hits reel.</strong> It's not the saddest story you can think of. It's not what you think admissions officers want to hear. It's about <strong>discovery</strong>-writing to uncover your thoughts, not just reporting what you already know.</p>
<blockquote>"Between the grades, the activities, and the accomplishments on your transcript, who are you?"</blockquote>
<p>Before you can answer that, you need to find your material. The students who write the strongest essays spend time here-exploring their experiences, finding moments that matter, and drafting to discover what they actually have to say.</p>
<p><strong>Don't skip this step.</strong></p>
