<h2>The Challenge</h2>
<p>The college essay is different from every other essay you’ve written. Academic essays have clear rubrics and established structures. In a sense, they test you on what you have learned. The college essay asks you to do something you rarely practice, which is to write as a way to examine your life. </p>
<h2><strong>Writing as a tool for discovery. </strong></h2>
<div class="callout"><span class="icon">💡</span><div class="callout-content">Most students skip this step. They choose a topic, something they think admissions will like, something traumatic, or something they've seen on TikTok. But the truth is, they haven’t written to discover anything. They're reporting on their life, instead of exploring what it all means. </div></div>
<h2>Topics vs. Moments</h2>
<p>Before you start writing, it is important to know the difference between a topic and a moment. The first mistake students make is that they start too broadly.</p>
<p>Academic essays have clear rubrics and established structures. They test what you've <strong>learned</strong>.</p>
<p>The college essay asks you to do something harder: look at your own life and figure out what you actually want to say about it.</p>
<p><strong>This isn't a greatest hits reel.</strong> It's not the saddest story you can think of. It's not what you think admissions officers want to hear. It's about <strong>discovery</strong>-writing to uncover your thoughts, not just reporting what you already know.</p>
<blockquote>"Between the grades, the activities, and the accomplishments on your transcript, who are you?"</blockquote>
<p>Before you can answer that, you need to find your material. The students who write the strongest essays spend time here-exploring their experiences, finding moments that matter, and drafting to discover what they actually have to say.</p>
<p><strong>Don't skip this step.</strong></p>
