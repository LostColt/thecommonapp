    <div class="accordion-item">
        <button class="accordion-header" aria-expanded="false" data-target="prompt1-body">
            <span class="prompt-number">Prompt 1:</span> Background, Identity, or Interest
            <span class="accordion-icon">+</span>
        </button>
        <div class="accordion-body" id="prompt1-body">
            <p><strong>The Prompt:</strong> "Some students have a background, identity, interest, or talent that is so meaningful they believe their application would be incomplete without it. If this sounds like you, then please share your story."</p>
            <p><strong>What They're Looking For:</strong> This is a chance to define yourself. Admissions wants to see how this element (whether it's being a first-generation student, a passion for cryptography, or a unique cultural identity) has shaped your **perspective, worldview, or daily decisions.** Focus less on summarizing the background and more on an **anecdote** that shows your identity in action.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="accordion-item">
        <button class="accordion-header" aria-expanded="false" data-target="prompt2-body">
            <span class="prompt-number">Prompt 2:</span> Challenge, Setback, or Failure
            <span class="accordion-icon">+</span>
        </button>
        <div class="accordion-body" id="prompt2-body">
            <p><strong>The Prompt:</strong> "The lessons we take from obstacles we encounter can be fundamental to later success. Recount a time when you faced a challenge, setback, or failure. How did it affect you, and what did you learn from the experience?"</p>
            <p><strong>What They're Looking For:</strong> They are *not* looking for the story of the challenge; they are looking for the story of the **lesson and recovery.** A great response focuses most of its word count on the **internal reflection,** the self-correction, and the way you apply the lesson learned to your life *now*. Avoid clichés like "I learned the importance of teamwork."</p>
        </div>

    <div class="accordion-item">
        <button class="accordion-header" aria-expanded="false" data-target="prompt3-body">
            <span class="prompt-number">Prompt 3:</span> Questioning a Belief or Idea
            <span class="accordion-icon">+</span>
        </button>
        <div class="accordion-body" id="prompt3-body">
            <p><strong>The Prompt:</strong> "Reflect on a time when you questioned or challenged a belief or idea. What prompted your thinking? What was the outcome?"</p>
            <p><strong>What They're Looking For:</strong> This prompt reveals **intellectual maturity and independent thinking.** Admissions wants to see the *process* of questioning—the research, the debate, the internal friction. The strongest essays show an **evolution of thought** and demonstrate that you are a complex thinker who can embrace nuance and ambiguity.</p>

    <div class="accordion-item">
        <button class="accordion-header" aria-expanded="false" data-target="prompt4-body">
            <span class="prompt-number">Prompt 4:</span> Gratitude
            <span class="accordion-icon">+</span>
        </button>
        <div class="accordion-body" id="prompt4-body">
            <p><strong>The Prompt:</strong> "Reflect on something that someone has done for you that has made you happy or thankful in a surprising way. How has this gratitude affected or motivated you?"</p>
            <p><strong>What They're Looking For:</strong> This prompt tests your **empathy and ability to connect** with others. The best essays here use the act of kindness as a springboard to discuss a deep personal value—for instance, how a small gesture from a neighbor led you to a lifelong dedication to community service. It's an essay about *your* character, revealed through someone else's actions.</p>

    <div class="accordion-item">
        <button class="accordion-header" aria-expanded="false" data-target="prompt5-body">
            <span class="prompt-number">Prompt 5:</span> Accomplishment, Event, or Realization
            <span class="accordion-icon">+</span>
        </button>
        <div class="accordion-body" id="prompt5-body">
            <p><strong>The Prompt:</strong> "Discuss an accomplishment, event, or realization that sparked a period of personal growth and a new understanding of yourself or others."</p>
            <p><strong>What They're Looking For:</strong> **Be careful:** Admissions is *not* interested in the achievement itself (they have your résumé). They want the **realization.** Focus intensely on the "new understanding" and show the change in your thinking or behavior *after* the event.</p>

    <div class="accordion-item">
        <button class="accordion-header" aria-expanded="false" data-target="prompt6-body">
            <span class="prompt-number">Prompt 6:</span> Engaging Topic, Idea, or Concept
            <span class="accordion-icon">+</span>
        </button>
        <div class="accordion-body" id="prompt6-body">
            <p><strong>The Prompt:</strong> "Describe a topic, idea, or concept you find so engaging that it makes you lose all track of time. Why does it captivate you? What or who do you turn to when you want to learn more?"</p>
            <p><strong>What They're Looking For:</strong> This is a pure measure of **intellectual curiosity.** Use this to demonstrate your potential as a successful college student. The topic doesn't need to be academic (it could be urban planning, obscure musical genres, or complex ethical dilemmas), but your engagement must be. Show your independent, unprompted drive to learn.</p>

    <div class="accordion-item">
        <button class="accordion-header" aria-expanded="false" data-target="prompt7-body">
            <span class="prompt-number">Prompt 7:</span> Topic of Your Choice
            <span class="accordion-icon">+</span>
        </button>
        <div class="accordion-body" id="prompt7-body">
            <p><strong>The Prompt:</strong> "Share an essay on any topic of your choice. It can be one you've already written, one that responds to a different prompt, or one of your own design."</p>
            <p><strong>What They're Looking For:</strong> This is for the student who has a truly unique story that cannot be forced into one of the other six categories. Its freedom is its challenge; it must still answer the core question: **What do you want us to know about you that we can't find anywhere else?**</p>

            <p><strong>The Essay Goal:</strong> Remember, the essay should show admissions officers who you are *beyond* your grades and activities list. It is fundamentally about <strong>self-awareness, intellectual curiosity, and maturity.</strong> Choose the prompt that allows you to tell the most revealing story about your internal world.</p>
