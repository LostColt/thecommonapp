      <div class="prose"><p>The hardest part of this essay isn't the writing. It's the honesty.</p>
<p>You're 17 or 18 years old, and you're being asked to write about yourself with clarity and self-awareness to a room full of strangers who will judge you. That's vulnerable. It's uncomfortable. And it's worth doing well.</p>
<p><strong>Don't perform.</strong> Don't write what you think they want. Write what's actually true.</p>
<p><strong>They'll know the difference.</strong></p>
