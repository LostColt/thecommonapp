      <p class="page-subtitle">Don't worry about picking the right one. Worry about picking the one that lets you tell your honest story.</p>
      <div class="prose"><h3>Prompt 1: The Identity Story</h3>
<p>Some students have a background, identity, interest, or talent that is so meaningful they believe their application would be incomplete without it. If this sounds like you, then please share your story.</p>
<h3>Prompt 2: The Challenge Story</h3>
<p>The lessons we take from obstacles we encounter can be fundamental to later success. Recount a time when you faced a challenge, setback, or failure. How did it affect you, and what did you learn from the experience?</p>
<h3>Prompt 3: The Belief Story</h3>
<p>Reflect on a time when you questioned or challenged a belief or idea. What prompted your thinking? What was the outcome?</p>
<h3>Prompt 4: The Gratitude Story</h3>
<p>Reflect on something that someone has done for you that has made you happy or thankful in a surprising way. How has this gratitude affected or motivated you?</p>
<h3>Prompt 5: The Intellectual Story</h3>
<p>Describe a topic, idea, or concept you find so engaging that it makes you lose all track of time. Why does it captivate you? What or who do you turn to when you want to learn more?</p>
<h3>Prompt 6: The Growth Story</h3>
<p>Discuss an accomplishment, event, or realization that sparked a period of personal growth and a new understanding of yourself or others.</p>
<h3>Prompt 7: Your Choice</h3>
<p>Share an essay on any topic of your choice. It can be one you've already written, one that responds to a different prompt, or one of your own design.</p>

<h2>What They're Really Asking</h2>
<p>All seven prompts are just different doorways into the same room. The room is <strong>you</strong>.</p>
<p>Admissions officers aren't judging you on which prompt you pick. They are judging you on <strong>clarity</strong> and <strong>depth</strong>.</p>
<li><strong>Don't worry</strong> about picking the "right" prompt.</li>
<li><strong>Do worry</strong> about picking the prompt that lets you tell your most honest story.</li>
<p>No matter which one you choose, the real question is always: <strong>"What matters to you, and why?"</strong></p></div>
