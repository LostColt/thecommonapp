      <h1 class="page-title">The Seven Doorways</h1>
      <p class="page-subtitle">Don't worry about picking the right one. Worry about picking the one that lets you tell your honest story.</p>
      <div class="prose"><p>What you need to know about the Prompts</p>
<p>The Common App gives you seven prompts. That's seven different ways to begin. But here's what most students miss: <strong>the prompts aren't really different.</strong></p>
<p>They're all asking the same thing. They're all trying to get you to reveal something meaningful about who you are. The only difference is the angle — the doorway you walk through to get there.</p>
<p>Some students obsess over picking the "right" prompt. They analyze each one, trying to figure out which will make them look best. This is a mistake.</p>
<div class="callout"><span class="callout-icon">💡</span><div class="callout-content"><strong>The prompt doesn't matter. Your story matters.</strong></div></div>
<p>Pick the prompt that gives you the clearest path to your most honest material. That's it. If your story fits multiple prompts, just pick one and move on.</p>
<p>Below are the seven prompts, decoded. Each one is a different lens for looking at the same question: <em>What matters to you, and why?</em></p>
<div class="prose">
    <div class="callout">
        <div class="callout-icon">💡</div>
        <div class="callout-content">
            <p><strong>The Essay Goal:</strong> The essay should show admissions officers who you are *beyond* your grades and activities list. It is fundamentally about <strong>self-awareness, intellectual curiosity, and maturity.</strong> Choose the prompt that allows you to tell the most revealing story about your internal world.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h3 id="prompt-1">Prompt 1: Background, Identity, or Interest</h3>
    <p><strong>The Prompt:</strong> "Some students have a background, identity, interest, or talent that is so meaningful they believe their application would be incomplete without it. If this sounds like you, then please share your story."</p>
    <div class="callout">
        <div class="callout-content">
            <p><strong>What They're Looking For:</strong> This is a chance to define yourself. Admissions wants to see how this element (whether it's being a first-generation student, a passion for cryptography, or a unique cultural identity) has shaped your <strong>perspective, worldview, or daily decisions.</strong> Focus less on summarizing the background and more on an **anecdote** that shows your identity in action.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h3 id="prompt-2">Prompt 2: Challenge, Setback, or Failure</h3>
    <p><strong>The Prompt:</strong> "The lessons we take from obstacles we encounter can be fundamental to later success. Recount a time when you faced a challenge, setback, or failure. How did it affect you, and what did you learn from the experience?"</p>
    <div class="callout">
        <div class="callout-content">
            <p><strong>What They're Looking For:</strong> They are *not* looking for the story of the challenge; they are looking for the story of the **lesson and recovery.** A great response focuses most of its word count on the **internal reflection,** the self-correction, and the way you apply the lesson learned to your life *now*. Avoid clichés like "I learned the importance of teamwork."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h3 id="prompt-3">Prompt 3: Questioning a Belief or Idea</h3>
    <p><strong>The Prompt:</strong> "Reflect on a time when you questioned or challenged a belief or idea. What prompted your thinking? What was the outcome?"</p>
    <div class="callout">
        <div class="callout-content">
            <p><strong>What They're Looking For:</strong> This prompt reveals **intellectual maturity and independent thinking.** Admissions wants to see the *process* of questioning—the research, the debate, the internal friction. The strongest essays show an **evolution of thought** and demonstrate that you are a complex thinker who can embrace nuance and ambiguity.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h3 id="prompt-4">Prompt 4: Gratitude</h3>
    <p><strong>The Prompt:</strong> "Reflect on something that someone has done for you that has made you happy or thankful in a surprising way. How has this gratitude affected or motivated you?"</p>
    <div class="callout">
        <div class="callout-content">
            <p><strong>What They're Looking For:</strong> This prompt tests your **empathy and ability to connect** with others. The best essays here use the act of kindness as a springboard to discuss a deep personal value—for instance, how a small gesture from a neighbor led you to a lifelong dedication to community service. It's an essay about *your* character, revealed through someone else's actions.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h3 id="prompt-5">Prompt 5: Accomplishment, Event, or Realization</h3>
    <p><strong>The Prompt:</strong> "Discuss an accomplishment, event, or realization that sparked a period of personal growth and a new understanding of yourself or others."</p>
    <div class="callout">
        <div class="callout-content">
            <p><strong>What They're Looking For:</strong> This is the most common prompt and often the most tempting. **Be careful:** Admissions is *not* interested in the achievement itself (they have your résumé). They want the **realization.** Focus intensely on the "new understanding" and show the change in your thinking or behavior *after* the event.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h3 id="prompt-6">Prompt 6: Engaging Topic, Idea, or Concept</h3>
    <p><strong>The Prompt:</strong> "Describe a topic, idea, or concept you find so engaging that it makes you lose all track of time. Why does it captivate you? What or who do you turn to when you want to learn more?"</p>
    <div class="callout">
        <div class="callout-content">
            <p><strong>What They're Looking For:</strong> This is a pure measure of **intellectual curiosity.** Use this to demonstrate your potential as a successful college student. The topic doesn't need to be academic (it could be urban planning, obscure musical genres, or complex ethical dilemmas), but your engagement must be. Show your independent, unprompted drive to learn.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h3 id="prompt-7">Prompt 7: Topic of Your Choice</h3>
    <p><strong>The Prompt:</strong> "Share an essay on any topic of your choice. It can be one you've already written, one that responds to a different prompt, or one of your own design."</p>
    <div class="callout">
        <div class="callout-content">
            <p><strong>What They're Looking For:</strong> This is for the student who has a truly unique story that cannot be forced into one of the other six categories. Only choose this if your essay is already written and is undeniably strong. Its freedom is its challenge; it must still answer the core question: **What do you want us to know about you that we can't find anywhere else?**</p>
        </div>

<h2>What They're Really Asking</h2>
<p>All seven prompts are just different doorways into the same room. The room is <strong>you</strong>.</p>
<p>Admissions officers aren't judging you on which prompt you pick. They are judging you on <strong>clarity</strong> and <strong>depth</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Don't worry</strong> about picking the "right" prompt.</li>
<li><strong>Do worry</strong> about picking the prompt that lets you tell your most honest story.</li>
</ul>
<p>No matter which one you choose, the real question is always: <strong>"What matters to you, and why?"</strong></p>
