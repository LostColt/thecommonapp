      <div class="prose"><p>What you need to know about the Prompts</p>
<p>The Common App gives you seven prompts. That's seven different ways to begin. But here's what most students miss: <strong>the prompts aren't really different.</strong></p>
<p>They're all asking the same thing. They're all trying to get you to reveal something meaningful about who you are. The only difference is the angle — the doorway you walk through to get there.</p>
<p>Some students obsess over picking the "right" prompt. They analyze each one, trying to figure out which will make them look best. This is a mistake.</p>
<div class="callout"><span class="icon">💡</span><div class="callout-content"><strong>The prompt doesn't matter. Your story matters.</strong></div></div>
<p>Pick the prompt that gives you the clearest path to your most honest material. That's it. If your story fits multiple prompts, just pick one and move on.</p>
<p>Below are the seven prompts, decoded. Each one is a different lens for looking at the same question: <em>What matters to you, and why?</em></p>

<h2>What They're Really Asking</h2>
<p>All seven prompts are just different doorways into the same room. The room is <strong>you</strong>.</p>
<p>Admissions officers aren't judging you on which prompt you pick. They are judging you on <strong>clarity</strong> and <strong>depth</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Don't worry</strong> about picking the "right" prompt.</li>
<li><strong>Do worry</strong> about picking the prompt that lets you tell your most honest story.</li>
</ul>
<p>No matter which one you choose, the real question is always: <strong>"What matters to you, and why?"</strong></p>
